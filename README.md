## End-to-End ETL Pipeline using Python, Pandas & PostgreSQL

An end-to-end **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **PostgreSQL**. This project extracts raw sales data from the **Olist Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset**, profiles and cleans the data, validates data quality, and loads the transformed datasets into PostgreSQL while preserving relationships using **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.

---

# Database Schema

The cleaned data is loaded into PostgreSQL and connected using relational constraints to preserve data integrity.

# Data Extraction

The pipeline begins by extracting multiple CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.

### Tasks Performed

- Read raw CSV files
- Loaded multiple datasets
- Stored datasets in a dictionary for processing

---

# Data Profiling

Initial profiling helps understand the quality of raw data before transformation.

Checks performed:

- Dataset dimensions
- Data types
- Missing values
- Duplicate rows

---

# Data Cleaning & Transformation

Different cleaning strategies were applied to different tables.

### Customers

- Removed leading/trailing spaces
- Standardized city names
- Standardized state names
- Removed duplicate records

### Orders

- Converted timestamps to datetime
- Standardized order status
- Removed duplicates

### Order Items

- Converted shipping dates
- Removed duplicates

### Payments

- Standardized payment types
- Identified invalid payment values

### Reviews

- Converted review timestamps
- Preserved business-valid NULL review comments

### Products

- Filled missing categories with **Unknown**
- Filled missing numerical values using median
- Removed duplicates

### Sellers

- Standardized city and state names

### Geolocation

- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized city and state names

### Category Translation

- Standardized category names
- Removed duplicates

# Data Validation

The transformed datasets are validated before loading.

Validation includes:

- Duplicate validation
- Missing value validation
- Customer ID validation
- Product ID validation
- Seller ID validation
- Order ID validation

---

# Data Loading

After successful validation, the cleaned datasets are loaded into PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy.

Each DataFrame is automatically converted into a PostgreSQL table.

# How to Run

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-cleaning-pipeline.git
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
